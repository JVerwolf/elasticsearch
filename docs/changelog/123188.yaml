  title: Add deprecation warning to `TransportHandshaker`
  area: REST API
  details: >
    Users will now see a deprecation log when a remote node, who's version is < v8.18, performs a transport handshake
    request with nodes >= v8.18 (e.g. during a CCS/CCR request). The remote cluster will need to be upgraded to >= v8.18
    to maintain compatibility with clusters that have been upgraded to v9.
  impact: >
   Users should upgrade any clusters older than v8.18 to >= 8.18 to maintain compatibility with clusters upgraded to v9.
